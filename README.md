### Introduction

Package `migrbc` provides mechanisms for classifying border crossings using a rules-based methodology. The goal of performing this type of classification is to identify any potential long-term migrants.  A long-term migration is defined as a border crossing involving a change in residence status. A border crossing counts as a long-term migration to/from a country if it entails a change from non-residence to residence / residence to non-residence. The rules-based classification that used to determine a long-term migration is defined by a threshold duration and a test duration, alternatively named window size. Under a "12/16" rule, for instance, the threshold duration is 12 months and the test duration (window size) is 16 months. With a "9/12" rule, the threshold duration is 9 months and the test duration (window size)  is 12 months.
