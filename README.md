### Introduction

This package provides mechanisms for classifying border crossings using a rules-based methodology. The goal of performing this type of classification is to identify any potential long-term migrants. A long-term migration is defined as a border crossing involving a change in residence status. A border crossing counts as a long-term migration to/from a country if it entails a change from non-residence to residence or residence to non-residence. The rules-based classification that used to determine a long-term migration is defined by a threshold duration and a test duration, alternatively named window size. Under a "12/16" rule, for instance, the threshold duration is 12 months and the test duration (window size) is 16 months. With a "9/12" rule, the threshold duration is 9 months and the test duration (window size)  is 12 months. For more information about the methodology applied, please visit Stats NZ (2020) <https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/defining-migrants-using-travel-histories-and-the-1216-month-rule>.

The main functions are:

* `run_rbc`: determines long-term migration statuses, and pre-crossing and post-crossing residence statuses, for all crossings where these statuses are not known.

* `pre_process`: provides a mechanism to divide large data into small chunks.

* `plot_mig_hist*`: by given a sequence of border crossings for a person, draw a diagram describing that person's migration history.
