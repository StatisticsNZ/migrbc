\title{Apply rule-based classification to identify which
migration or residence status are unknown}
\usage{
run_rbc(crossing_data, init_res_status_data = NULL, window_size = 487,
  threshold_year = 365, parallel = FALSE, n_core = 2, max_ram = 2,
  include_error_columns = FALSE, mc.cleanup = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{crossing_data}{A pre-processed group data contain
journeys, movements and IRS or the raw crossing data.}

\item{init_res_status_data}{The raw data of the initial residence status
in the format of data frame.}

\item{window_size}{The maximum length of the scanning period.
Can be an integer giving the number of days, the result
of a call to function \code{\link[base]{difftime}}, or an object of
class \code{\link[lubridate:Duration-class]{Duration}}.}

\item{threshold_year}{The length of the yearly test period.
It can be an integer giving the number of days, the result
of a call to function \code{\link[base]{difftime}}, or an object of
class \code{\link[lubridate:Duration-class]{Duration}}.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Whether to use parallel processing, to
speed up the calculation of migration statuses.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{n_core}{The number of cores to use, if \code{parallel} is
\code{TRUE}. Defaults to \code{2}. Higher values will
typically result in faster calculations on computers
with more than two cores.}

\item{max_ram}{Optional, it is used to limit the RAM that can be 
used by this function. The default value is 2 Gb.}

\item{include_error_columns}{Optional, if it is TRUE, the returned 
result of \code{error_data} will contain two extra columns
 \code{error_code} and \code{error_message}.}

\item{mc.cleanup}{Optional, if set to TRUE then all children that have been 
forked by this function will be killed (by sending SIGTERM) before
this function returns. Under normal circumstances mclapply waits
for the children to deliver results, so this option usually has 
only effect when mclapply is interrupted. If set to FALSE then 
child processes are collected, but not forcefully terminated.
As a special case this argument can be set to the number of the
signal that should be used to kill the children instead of SIGTERM.}
}
\value{
The number of rows in the FinalIsLongTermMig table.
}
\description{
Attempt to determine long-term migration statuses, and
pre-crossing and post-crossing residence statuses, for all
crossings where these statuses are not known.
